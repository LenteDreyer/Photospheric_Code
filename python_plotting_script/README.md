# Python script for plotting simulation results

In this repository,
in the file python_plotting_script, we include a simple Python 2.7 script to plot 
the code results. The Python libraries Numpy and Matplotlib are
needed to run the plotting script.

This Python script first

To run the Python script, in the terminal, cd in to the python_plotting_script directory. This directory 
contains the Python file py_phot_plot_script.py used for plotting and the 4 files
outputed at the end of the simulation. To run the plotting script, in the terminal type

python py_phot_plot_script.py

and hit enter. This python script saves the simulation results figure as a png and
eps file with the filenames fig_phot_code.png and fig_phot_code.eps, respectively.
The script then displays a window with the simulation results. Once done looking at
results, close the figure window to escape the Matplotlib figure environment.
