# Photospheric Code 

This is a Monte Carlo code that simulates the Photospheric process, one of the main
mechanisms studied to explain the prompt gamma-ray emission from Gamma-ray Bursts. This
code is described in this paper.

### Requirements for running code and plotting code results

The code is written in C++11. A compiler capable of interpreting C++11 is 
needed to run the code. The code results are outputed as binary files. Pretty
much any programming language can be used to plot the code results. In this repository,
we give a simply script to plot the code results with Python 2.7.
