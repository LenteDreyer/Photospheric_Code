# Photospheric Code 

This is a Monte Carlo code that simulates the Photospheric process, one of the main
mechanisms studied to explain the prompt gamma-ray emission from Gamma-ray Bursts. The
code is described in this paper: 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.1049S

### Requirements for running code and plotting code results

The code is written in C++11. A compiler capable of interpreting C++11 is 
needed to run the code. The code results are outputed as binary files. 
Any programming language can be used to plot the code results. In this repository,
in the file python_plotting_script, we include a simple Python 2.7 script to plot 
the code results.

### Downloading the code
